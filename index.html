            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a computer science graduate student at IIIT Hyderabad. Growing up, I was equally captivated by both physics and computers, the elegance of natural laws and the power of computational thinking. When choosing my undergraduate path, I followed my curiosity about the fundamental nature of the universe and pursued Engineering Physics at IIT Roorkee.
            </p>
            <p>
                During those years, I discovered that my fascination with computers ran deeper than I had imagined. While studying physics gave me a strong foundation in mathematical modeling and problem-solving, I found myself increasingly drawn to how computational methods could be applied to solve complex problems. This led me to explore machine learning, computer vision, and software development. I worked on projects ranging from optimizing perovskite solar cells using deep learning to building retrieval-augmented generation systems and full-stack web applications. The intersection of my physics background and computer science created a unique perspective, I approach computational problems with the rigor of a physicist and the creativity of a developer.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, as I pursue my master's in computer science, I'm fully committed to this path. I'm driven by the challenge of building systems that solve real-world problems and the excitement of working in a field that constantly evolves. Whether it's implementing neural networks, developing scalable applications, or exploring new frameworks, I find purpose in bridging theory with practical impact.
